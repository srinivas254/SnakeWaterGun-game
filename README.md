# Snake Water Gun Game
This project is a simple web-based implementation of the popular "Snake Water Gun" game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to compete against the computer by choosing one of three options: Snake, Water, or Gun, and then comparing their choices to determine the winner.

# How to Play
Open the game in your web browser.

Choose your move by clicking on one of the buttons:

Snake: Represented by the snake icon.
Water: Represented by the water icon.
Gun: Represented by the gun icon.
The computer randomly selects its move.

The game compares your move with the computer's move to determine the winner:
